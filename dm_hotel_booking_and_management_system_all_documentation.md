# DM Hotel Booking and management system

## Project Description
Act as a Senior Software Architect, Security Engineer, UX Designer, and Technical Documentation Writer.

Your task is to generate complete professional system documentation for a modern hotel platform called:

D&M Travelers Inn Booking Management System

The documentation must be production-ready, structured, and written for a professional development team.

The platform must include two main systems:

Public Website (Customer Facing)

Admin Management System

Security, scalability, performance, and maintainability must be treated as core design priorities.

Core Architecture Requirement

The system must follow a secure decoupled architecture.

Frontend and backend must be fully separated.

Frontend will never directly access the database.

Architecture flow:

Frontend → RESTful API → Backend → Database

Benefits:

Strong security

Clean architecture

Better scalability

Independent deployments

Safe credential management

Technology Stack

Frontend

React / Next.js

TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Framer Motion for UI animations

Optional animation libraries (GSAP or CSS animations)

Backend

Node.js API server

RESTful API architecture

Secure middleware

Database

Supabase PostgreSQL

Authentication

Admin users:

Secure login authentication

JWT-based sessions

Public users:

No accounts required

Email verification booking system

Deployment

Frontend:

Vercel

Backend:

Server or serverless deployment

Email System

SMTP email service for booking verification codes and booking confirmations

Payment Integration

Stripe

PayPal

GCash

Security Requirements

Security must be a core system design principle.

RESTful API Architecture

Frontend communicates with backend using secure REST APIs.

Example endpoints:

Authentication

POST /api/admin/login

POST /api/admin/logout

Bookings

GET /api/bookings

POST /api/bookings

PATCH /api/bookings/{id}

Rooms

GET /api/rooms

POST /api/rooms

PATCH /api/rooms/{id}

Reviews

GET /api/reviews

POST /api/reviews

Restaurant

GET /api/menu

POST /api/menu

Analytics

GET /api/reports

All APIs must use:

HTTPS

Request validation

Secure authentication

Environment Variables (.env)

Sensitive credentials must never be hardcoded.

All secrets must be stored in environment variables.

Example .env configuration:

DATABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=

SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASSWORD=

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
GCASH_API_KEY=

ADMIN_API_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=

Include documentation for managing environment variables in development and production.

API Security

Implement security best practices:

JWT authentication

Role-based access control

Input sanitization

Rate limiting

CSRF protection

SQL injection prevention
